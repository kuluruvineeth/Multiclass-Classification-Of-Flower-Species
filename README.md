## Iris Flowers Dataset
This dataset is well studied and is a good problem for practicing on neural netowrks because all of the 4 input variables are numeric and have the same scale in centimeters.
Each instance describes the properties of an observed flower measurements and output variable is specific iris species.

## The Attributes of this dataset
1. Sepal length in centimeters
2. Sepal width in centimeters
3. Petal width in centimeters
4. Petal length in centimeters
5. Class

## We can achieve model accuracy in the range of 95% to 97%.
